# Multiplex Genotyping Sample
Repo contains some sample code for sample genotyping. Expected input file is "input.txt" located within the same directory as python script. Functionality has not yet been added for manually specifying a file location.

Areas for improvement include more customization for data input/user feedback; as well as error handling - very little error handling has been put in place initially, outside of some exceptions for unexpected data.

Some basic unit testing has been added at the bottom of the python file, it is not extensive but can serve as a starting point.

No additional library installations are required for execution; hence the empty `requirements.txt` file.
